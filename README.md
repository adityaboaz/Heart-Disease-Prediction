# Heart Disease Prediction System

## Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user input. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the system provides insights and predictions to help users understand their cardiovascular health risks. The application is built using Flask for the backend, and integrates with a machine learning model to perform predictions.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Allows users to input various health parameters to assess their risk of heart disease.
- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- **Results Display**: Shows the prediction results and risk factors based on user input.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of prediction data (if implemented).

## Installation

To set up the Heart Disease Prediction System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
https://github.com/adityaboaz/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
   ```bash
   
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Heart_Disease_prediction-WebApp
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:
